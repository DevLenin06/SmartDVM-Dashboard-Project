# SmartDVM-Dashboard-Project
This repo documents the development of a Random Forest model to improve diagnosis suggestions for SmartDVMâ€™s veterinary dashboard. It covers data preprocessing, feature engineering, training, and evaluation. The final model will be stored here for integration, providing vets with more accurate, data-driven support. The trained Random Forest model will be deployed via an API, allowing the SmartDVM dashboard to send patient data and receive real-time diagnosis suggestions automatically.
